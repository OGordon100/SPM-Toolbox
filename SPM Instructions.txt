SPM Notes

GENERAL
- Don't stamp heavily, don't even touch table if scanning as will ruin image

XY SCANNER WINDOW:
- Be careful of setpoint too high (tip crash)
- Faster scan speed = more gain, lower quality image
- To find windows, go to windows toolbar (right click = open, left = close)
- Scan region in green. Can drag and move about. Wants to do square, but can make rectangle and use angles
- Below zoom in/out button is centre window button
- Increasing time between points decreases speed
- 150nm/s is decent speed, but on the fast side
- For a larger image, use slower speed
- All changes are instantaneous, so can do in middle of image
- At bottom of window can stop, start, pause

Z FORWARD WINDOW:
- Can zoom in and out with scroll wheel
- Pan by clicking middle mouse button
- Green line/circle is the current tip position
- On pause, will see green circle where currently scanning
- On stop, green circle goes back to left bottom corner
- Images don't get overwritten
- Can move image to XY scanner window by pressing "alt" and dragging to green 
	square. This gives spatial reference to whole surface 
- Pressing very bottom red button at bottom right corner resets view to current scan location
- Pressing other button will change scan grid axis based on where mouse is hovered over
- Top right corner shows scan line number. Write down if see interesting things
- Top left corner shows index number of image
	- e.g. up = 19_1, down = 19_1, next up = 19_2, etc
	- If press stop, start, = 20_1, etc
- If contrast isn't good, right click on window->properties->display properties->reset

Z REGULATION WINDOW:
- V gap
- Loop gain
- I setpoint
- Green bar shows height of tip relative to piezoelectric motor (doesn't really matter)

Z CHANNEL WINDOW:
- Shows tip current along the green line in Z forward window
- "Height" coming "out" of monitor relative to Z forward window image
- Updates with speed given in XY scanner

TIP CONDITIONING WINDOW:
- For crashing tip
- Don't touch voltage pulse (for relly bad tips)
- Z ramp
	- Change delta z
	- minus = down
	- After a crash, will automatically come back
	- On Z forward window, select bottom left corner-> Z ramp -> Select position by clicking -> Crash
	- -0.5nm is good
	- Will not leave very big blob if tip is good & vice versa

ATOM MANIPULATION WINDOW:
- In z regulation, use bottom left corner button to click and drag a blue line
- Push/drag atoms
- I(R) manipulation window gives current along tip path. If it goes up then atom being moved :D
- Increase speed when doing manipulation
- Gap voltage -0.1V, Current 300pA, Movement, -0.001V, Z -0.1nm, saw 25nA current when moving (=adam success)
-
